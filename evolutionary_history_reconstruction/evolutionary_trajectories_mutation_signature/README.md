Reconstructing evolutionary trajectories of mutation signature activities in Sarcoma

The type and genomic context of cancer mutations depend on their causes. These causes have been characterized using signatures that represent mutation types that co-occur in the same tumours
Two R packages were used to identify how  mutation processes change during cancer evolution in Sarcomas.


*MutSignatures
*MutationalPatterns
