This repository contains scripts to generate inputs, process outputs and visualize the results for sarcoma tumour evolution projects.

Each script is housed in a separate subdirectory based on the analysis type, which contains all related files, if applicable. Example plots are available in some cases.

* NOTE: If you have any question about the scripts please contact me at shaghayegh.soudi@gmail.com
